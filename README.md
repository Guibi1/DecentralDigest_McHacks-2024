# Decentral Digest

A decentralized and unbiased news site

## Inspiration ðŸ˜‹

DecentralDigest is born from the pressing need to revolutionize the way we consume news. In an era filled with biased reporting and centralized control, our project is a response to the growing demand for unbiased, decentralized news sources. We believe that access to reliable information is a fundamental right, and we aim to empower users by providing a platform that ensures transparency, neutrality, and user ownership.
What it does ðŸ¤“

In today's world, where misinformation and biased reporting abound, DecentralDigest stands as a beacon of truth. Our platform starts by scraping news sites, finding common information, and eliminating bias. We employ advanced AI technologies, including GPT, to generate unbiased news articles. These articles are securely stored on IPFS and the blockchain, ensuring decentralization and resistance to censorship.

But we go beyond providing news. DecentralDigest offers an innovative NFT minting feature. Users can mint NFTs as a record of their readership, giving them ownership of the news they consume. This not only enhances user engagement but also promotes user ownership of information.

We're not stopping there. We plan to integrate Twilio for daily updates on global topics and sentiment analysis of social media. Users can wake up to text messages summarizing the day's most discussed topics around the world.

## What's next for DecentralDigest ðŸ˜Š

As we look to the future, DecentralDigest envisions expanding its capabilities even further. Our roadmap includes:

### Sentiment Analysis on Social Media ðŸ˜†

We aim to take user engagement to the next level by analyzing sentiment on platforms like Weibo, WeChat, Twitter, and Reddit. This analysis will provide users with insights into global opinions on various topics, enhancing their understanding of current events.

### User-Contributed Articles with Bias Detection ðŸ‘Œ

We plan to allow users to contribute articles, but with a twist. Our platform will scan user-contributed content for bias, ensuring that the information remains reliable and unbiased. This feature sets us apart by maintaining the integrity of the content.

### Enhanced NFT Integration

In addition to minting NFTs for articles, we're exploring the possibility of creating NFTs for article images. This will add a unique visual element to the ownership of news content, making it even more engaging.

### Business Growth ðŸ˜’

DecentralDigest is also actively seeking partnerships and collaborations to expand its reach and impact. We are dedicated to promoting transparency, unbiased reporting, and user empowerment in the digital news landscape. Our vision is to become a leading force in the news industry, reshaping how people access and own information.

Join us in our mission to reshape news consumption for a decentralized, informed future! Together, we can ensure that reliable, unbiased news is accessible to all.
